This is a part of assignments that I'll be doing as part of The Odin Project. The goal here is to make a webpage that looks like the Google homepage. While I've achieved a webpage that does look remarkably similar to an archive version of Google from 2019, it's obviously far from perfect. It lacks several hover effects, proper text coloration, some other font effects et al, but I feel all in all it is a good visual clone. I've now marked this project as complete, and you can view the results at https://deadwolf666.github.io/google-homepage/
