This is a part of assignments that I'll be doing as part of The Odin Project. The goal here is to make a webpage that looks like the Google homepage, and additionally hard code a Google search page too. So far I've made the Google logo and basic navbar (without using lists) but having trouble with the search input bar. Hopefully that will be resolved soon!
